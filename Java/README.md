Lab. work № 1 — Task № 1:
Calculate the value of the expression for positive values x — sin (x^3) + (x^4) + (x^2 + x^3)^0.2.

Lab. work № 1 — Task № 2:
Determine whether a point with coordinates (x, y) falls into the specified area y >= 0, y <= 2-x, y <= x+2.

Lab. work № 2 — Task № 1:
A array of n integers is given. Find the maximum element in this array.

Lab. work № 2 — Task № 2:
A array of integers is given, followed by 0. Find the maximum element in this array.

Lab. work № 3 — Task № 1:
The work should be performed only using an array. After each item, output the data to the console.
1) Form an array of n elements using a random number sensor (n is set
by the user using the keyboard).
2) Remove all elements larger than the arithmetic mean of the array elements.
3) Add K elements to the end of the array.
4) Find the first even element.
5) Sort the array using the simple inclusion method.

Lab. work № 4 — Task № 1:
1) Form a dynamic array of instances of the class:
class Employee
{
String name;
double salary;
int stage
};.
2) Search for elements in the array - employees whose name begins with the letter ‘L'.
3) Perform processing - add K elements to the beginning of the array.
4) The above operations are performed via the console menu.

Lab. work № 5 — Application № 1:
Develop an application with a graphical interface. Create a parent class with constant values and with the entered values of the object fields. Objects should be placed in the list. Using the application interface, it is necessary to ensure that instances of the parent class are read and written, as well as the execution of their methods. Output the results in two ways: in separate fields of the JTextField form and in the JTable table.
Parent class room: length, width, height (in meters). In the class, implement two methods for calculating the area of walls (with windows and doors) and the area of walls without a window (size 2×1.5 m) and doors (size 2 × 1.6 m).

Laboratory Work № 5 — Application № 2 Jpanel:
Expand Application #1 — add a descendant class. Class-Descendant - Office: it consists of a room with (length, width, height) and a corridor with (length, width, height). In the class, implement a method to determine the amount of paint needed to paint the walls and ceiling of office premises. Additionally, the paint consumption per 1 m2 is set. Objects should be placed in the list. Using the application interface, it is necessary to ensure that instances of the parent class are read and written, as well as the execution of their methods. Output results to separate fields of the JTextField form.

Laboratory Work № 5 — Application № 2 Jtable:
Modify the previous application — provide reading and writing to the Jtable table.
